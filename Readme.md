## Summary
A set of scripts to process images (fluorescent and bright-field) acquired through standard epimicroscopes under low magnification. These beads are typically of variant Tentagel or PEGA and range in sizes from 50-200um. Smaller beads, like magnetic or nanometer sized beads are not suitable for the algorithms used in the analysis. The experiments are typically - (a) dyescreen and (b) non-specific fluorescent dye binding where beads are labeled with different fluorophores. The fluorescent intensity of the beads across the different channels are to be monitored after different treatments. The image processing works mainly to detect these beads as circles and maps their intensity across the different channels.
